#This R code is designed to gather infant vaccination information reported by moms
#and to relate it to fever events. 

# Required files: 
# 1. REDCap data: MILQMAINSTUDYDENMARK_DATA_2022-10-11_2251.csv
# 2. metadata file with sequencing and morbidity info: infant.morbidities.medications.csv
# These were accessed via the shared MILQ folder and generated from "01_Denmark_morbidity_frequency.R" respectively 

# ---- STEP 0: set working directory and load packages ----
setwd("/Users/local-margaret/Desktop/MILQ-Denmark/") 

#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# ---- STEP 1: read in the metadata file with morbidity information for the samples included in analysis ---- 
#Note: this file can be generated using "01_Denmark_morbidity_frequency.R" 
metadata <- read.csv("data/infant.morbidities.medications.csv")
metadata <- metadata[,-1]

# ---- STEP 2: read in the redcap data and correct the two maternal IDs ---- 
redcap <- read.csv("data/MILQMAINSTUDYDENMARK_DATA_2022-10-11_2251.csv")
redcap[redcap$mid=="MD346m","mid"] <- "MD346M"
redcap[redcap$mid=="MD378x","mid"] <- "MD378X"

# ---- STEP 3: pull out the redcap data for the 109 infants included in the analyses ---- 
redcap.v2 <- redcap[c(which(redcap$mid %in% metadata$mid)),]

# ---- STEP 4: see if any moms reported vaccinations for their infants ---- 
table(redcap.v2$f204_immz_q11)
#10 infants had immunizations sometime before 3.5 months of life. 
table(redcap.v2$f304_immz_q11)
#107 infants had immunizations sometime between their visit 2 and visit 3.
table(redcap.v2$f404_immz_q11)
#82 infants had immunizations sometime between their visit 3 and visit 4.

# STEP 5: create a bar graph of the number of infants with vaccination reported at each visit ----

#since so many infants had vaccinations (many more than the number of infants
#with a fever in the same visit as the vaccination) there won't be a simple 
#relationship to draw between fever and vaccinations 
#And no question was asked in the questionnaires for the mothers to state the diagnosis 
# of the fever, so can't determine if the fever was due to the vaccine.
#Bar graphs will include a percentage of those infants that had fever in the same visit.
